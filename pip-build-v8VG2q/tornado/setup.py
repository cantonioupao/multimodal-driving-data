Here are some hints for popular operating systems:

If you are seeing this message on Linux you probably need to
install GCC and/or the Python development package for your
version of Python.

Debian and Ubuntu users should issue the following command:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

RedHat and CentOS users should issue the following command:

    $ sudo yum install gcc python-devel

Fedora users should issue the following command:

    $ sudo dnf install gcc python-devel

MacOS users should run:

    $ xcode-select --install
